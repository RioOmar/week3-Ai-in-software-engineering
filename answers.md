1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?
TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.
Key Features:

Scalability across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
Easy model building using Keras API.
Automatic differentiation with TensorFlow’s GradientTape.
TensorFlow Lite for mobile and embedded devices.
TensorFlow.js for machine learning in the browser.


2.
What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs where the entire graph is defined before execution.
PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs that are built and modified on the fly during execution, making it more flexible and easier to debug.


3.
What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?
Keras is a high-level deep learning API that simplifies building neural networks. It can run on top of frameworks like:

TensorFlow
Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)
Theano (discontinued)


4.
What are the key features of Scikit-learn?
Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python.
Key Features:

Simple and consistent API.
Tools for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
Wide range of supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
Cross-validation support.
Built-in datasets like Iris and Boston housing.


5.
What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?
Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web-based environments for writing and running code.
Key Features:

Supports multiple programming languages (Python, R, Julia).
Code execution with inline output.
Markdown for documentation.
Data visualization support.
Easy sharing and collaboration.


6.
In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?
The Dropout layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training, forcing the model to learn more robust features.


7.
What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?
The optimizer updates the model’s weights to minimize the loss function. The optimizer used is typically Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.


8.
In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?
The Conv2D layer applies convolution operations to the input image, extracting important features like edges, shapes, and textures.


9.
What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?
The model used is typically a Logistic Regression classifier applied to the Iris dataset.


10.
What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?
The output is a data visualization like a scatter plot or histogram. The library commonly used is Matplotlib or Seaborn.
